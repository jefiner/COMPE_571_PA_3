task	deadline 	execution time 
w1 	520 		53 
w2 	220		40 
w3 	500 		104  
w4 	200 		57

- have delimter of each space between every integer
- each new value will be stored into a different array
- when file reaches to NULL (no more new information) it will exit out of loop
- otherwise, it will keep storing numbers into the array 
- possibly read the columns, not as rows in program
- 5 x 6 table

	- ex:// in each line of index in array[0] represents task
	- ex:// in each line of index in array[1] represents deadline
	- ex:// in each line of index in array[2] represents execution time


Current issue : fscanf will look at the 3rd value, store it in array, and print it out
